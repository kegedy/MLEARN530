1) Assuming the activations of the layer above consists of a sequence of embeddings with (d_model=) 1024 floating-point values per embedding, and the desired dimensionality of the feed-forward expansion is (d_ff=) 4096, what would be the dimensions of the weight matrices for a transformer block?

d_ff = 4*d_m

Then W = [rows,cols] = [1024,1024]
