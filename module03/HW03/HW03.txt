Would we expect this "deep" model (a model with more than one hidden layer) to beat (be more accurate than) a multinomial logistic regression model; i.e. would it beat a model defined as ... Why or why not?

The neural network creates an approximation of the target response. 
More layers provide greater capacity for the neural network to approximate the response.
